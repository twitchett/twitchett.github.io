## Profile

I'm a full-stack developer, working primarily with **Vue**, **React**, **Node**, **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Python**, **Docker**, **CouchDB**, and many other tools. In my spare time I'm really enjoying building things in **Clojure/ClojureScript**.

Above all, though, I'm looking for a great team rather than the perfect stack. My ideal role is one in which I can get to know my colleagues and work with them to solve challenging problems, exchanging knowledge, ideas, and a few beers in the process.
