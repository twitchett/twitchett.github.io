I built this site because having had my nose stuck in Angular 1 for the last 18 months, I wanted to do something different. Actually it was initially intended to be a React project, but this [Jekyll][jekyll] seems to have got all my bases covered. In fact this is probably the least use I have for Javascript on any site since, well, I started web development.

First time using a static-site generator, and I'm blown away by how easy it is to get something off the ground.

Having content and code so close together and under the same version control seems a bit icky, but maybe because I'm not used to working this way.
