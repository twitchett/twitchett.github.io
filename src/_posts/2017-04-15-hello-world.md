I built this site because having had my nose stuck in Angular 1 for the last year or so, I wanted to do something different. Actually it was initially intended to be a React project, but this [Jekyll][jekyll] is just making things too easy. And now I've got a collection of static pages which is pretty much exactly the opposite of a single page app. Ha. But it's fun.

First time using a static-site generator, and I'm blown away by how easy it is to get something off the ground.

Having content and code so close together and under the same version control seems a bit icky, but maybe I'm just not used to working this way.
